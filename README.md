# Smart-Stick-for-the-Visually-Impaired
A smart stick for the Blind using Arduino
The smart stick comes as a proposed solution to 
enable the blind to identify the world around. In this report we 
propose a solution, represented in a smart stick with a pair of 
ultrasonic sensor to detect any other obstacles in front of the user, 
within a range of 50 centimeters. This proposed system uses the 
Arduino R3 UNO microcontroller. 
The smart stick is of low cost, has a fast response, low power 
consumption and light weight
